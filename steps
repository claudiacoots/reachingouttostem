My original presentation: https://prezi.com/xth-snl3v5ux/reaching-out-to-stem/ Please modify in any way that fits with your country and keep sharing with other countries
Once used, share with me which country you are from and your school/organization name :)
Use this as a guide, not as a presentation
Reaching Out to STEM is all about making a difference and simply, being different. Begin the activity with having students finish this Google Form:
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfp0kchvmC0yBVoyedxJNfIMd-ZuCJlQz0OS5uFncYQCNiDZw/viewform 
Then begin activity with stereotypes
        Activity Example 1: Separate people by their eye color and neglect one eye color and ask how the neglected feel in front of the class
        Activity Example 2: Have pictures of a girl with blonde hair in a cheerleader uniform and one of a guy with glasses and braces and ask them to categorize the 2
        Activity Example 3: Have pictures of different cultures and ask students to guess what they eat on a daily basis (for older groups) https://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/international_projects/australian_educators/pedagogical_projects/bailey_activities1.pdf is an example (create own)
Explain stereotypes and add in that whether known or not, they are stereotyped too when it comes to jobs
Peer Pressure:
Peer Pressure activity trying to force someone to take something (a pencil or marker will do) or you will do something bad i.e tell everyone they act like a baby, older groups will get their picture posted from a party, etc.
Also include this happens when it comes to career choices as well as stereotypes
Have the 2 Come Together:
        Activity: Print off pictures with different careers being done. Have every student take a photo and stand on a side of the room for cool and uncool. I.E Left side is uncool and right side is cool. After picking sides, have them stand in a line on their side. (Most kids say the STEM jobs look really cool) and have them explain
        Tell them how the interesting jobs were STEM or now STEAM fields
        Use legos to have kids build certain shapes like hearts, squares, hexagon, etc.
        Tell how building is a key part of STE(A)M
        Talk about what STEM is
        Introduce FIRST Robotics
        Tell children that any career path is their choice, whether it is as a clown or a mathematician
        Relate to Bill Nye and Mythbusters
        Introduce FIRST Robotics and how they can join one in their school (it is global)
        Introoduce TSA for high school
Relate to social barriers, stereotypes, peer pressure in that they have all say in what they do
Encourage children to take action and do one nice thing at least per day
At very end, give them post survey https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdy-HI23_pW6xiTcjfkjThhMvy_aiCZadcmCsVK5N4CR9wkcQ/viewform
